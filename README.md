# ConwaysGameOfLife
An interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life, built with C# and .NET. Developed entirely within one month, showcasing rapid development skills, attention to detail, and a solid understanding of core software development concepts.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This application goes beyond basic implementation by combining user interactivity, persistent settings, and dynamic rendering — all under tight time constraints. It simulates the classic algorithm-driven rules of Conway’s Game of Life while giving users complete control over the simulation environment. 

The project reflects my ability to:
- Work independently with partially provided UI resources
- Translate algorithmic rules into functional code
- Integrate user input, state management, and real-time feedback
- Use Git and version control tools professionally

## 🚀 Features

- Fully interactive grid: toggle cells by clicking
- Start / Pause / Next step simulation controls
- Random generation (by time or seed)
- Save/load to PlainText
- Adjustable universe size, speed, and colors
- Toroidal and finite universe modes
- Status HUD: generations, live cells, size
- Context menu + persistent user settings
