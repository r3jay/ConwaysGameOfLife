# ConwaysGameOfLife
This is a fully interactive desktop version of Conway’s Game of Life, built in C# using WinForms. It started as a portfolio project, and I treated it like my first serious attempt at a polished software tool.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Being one of my earliest deep dives into C# and .NET, and built in a single month during my Project & Portfolio course, it challenged me to go beyond simple UI work and into simulating real logic-driven systems. It’s also where I learned how to balance front end with backend rules, which becomes a recurring pattern in dev work.

The project reflects my ability to:
- Work independently with partially provided UI resources
- Translate algorithmic rules into functional code
- Integrate user input, state management, and real-time feedback
- Use Git and version control tools professionally

## 🚀 Software Features

- Click to toggle cells on a grid
- Start / Pause / Step through simulation
- Randomize with a timer or custom seed
- Save/load universe states as PlainText
- Adjustable universe size, simulation speed, and cell colors
- Toroidal (wrap-around) or finite universe options
- Live status bar showing generations and living cells
- Context menu and persistent user settings

## 📌 Acknowledgements

UI layout, button design, and some front-end scaffolding were provided by the course instructor at Full Sail University.

All backend logic, simulation behavior, state handling, save/load systems, and custom features were designed and implemented independently.

This was one of the first projects where I felt like a real developer, seeing logic and UI come together in a smooth user experience.

Feel free to explore the code or reach out if you'd like to know more about the project.
